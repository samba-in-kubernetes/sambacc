title: "sambacc configuration"
description: |
  The configuration for the sambacc tool. sambacc configures Samba and the container
  environment to fit Samba's unique needs. This configuration can hold configuration
  for more than one server "instance". The "configs" section contains one or more
  configuration with a name that can be selected at runtime. Share definitions
  and samba global configuration blocks can be mixed and matched.
